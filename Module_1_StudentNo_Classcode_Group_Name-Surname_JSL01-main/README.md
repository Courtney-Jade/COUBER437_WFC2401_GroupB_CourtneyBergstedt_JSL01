# JSL01 Project
  - This project tests the users input and validates whether the input field has a valid syntax or invalid syntax.In order to code this user 
    interaction ,HTML , CSS and Javascript was used. Users will fill in the input field in a certain way. If it is done correctly e.g 
   pet_2020Asia the results will be Valid , however if it is done incorrectly e.g petAsia2020 , the results will be Invalid.

  # Challenges
   - I have hard time translating what I understand into a code.There are certain aspects I'm not fully grasping, which in turn leads to me struggling to put in the right codw.

# Improvement
-I need to keep practicing JavaScript in order to understand and become more proficent in it.
