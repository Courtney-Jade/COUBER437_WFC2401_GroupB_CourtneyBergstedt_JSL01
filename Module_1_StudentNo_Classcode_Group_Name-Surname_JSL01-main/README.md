# JSL01 Project
  - This project tests the users input and validates whether the input field has a valid syntax or invalid syntax.

  # Challenges
   - I have hard time translating what I understand into a code.There are certain aspects I'm not fully grasping, which in turn leads to me struggling to put in the right codw.

# Improvement
-I need to keep practicing JavaScript in order to understand and become more proficent in it.
