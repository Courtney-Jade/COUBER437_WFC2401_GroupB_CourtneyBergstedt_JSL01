# [JSL01] Submission: Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge

# Netlify Link

# JSL01 Project
  - This project tests the users input and validates whether the input field has a valid syntax or invalid syntax.

  # Challenges
   - I have hard time translating what I understand into a code.There are certain aspects I'm not fully grasping, which in turn leads to me struggling to put in the right code.

   # Improvement
    - The only way I can improve is by constantly practicing my Javscript in order to understand and become more proficient in it.
